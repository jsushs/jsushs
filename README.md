- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsushs
- 👀 I’m interested in creating REST tools for my agency to use in order to better manage the large amount of data and requests we receive and send.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Google API, Dash, JavaScript, Google AppScripts, SQLAlchemy, Flask.... I could be better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with my team on many projects to improve Agency and Staff efficiency with their workloads and the agency's reporting needs.
- 📫 How to reach me .... haven't decided yet.
